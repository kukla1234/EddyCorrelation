                High-quality eddy covariance data through 26 hours measured over a seagrass meadow in the Virginia 
                coastal bays. Raw data were recorded in 15 min data segments that included a short pause at the end. 
              </p>
                
              <p>
                First panel: Three velocity components (x, y, z), mean current velocity, and water depth. The velocity 
                was varying between 1 and 6 cm s-1 and driven mainly by tides. Some of the short-term variation in 
                velocity represents wave action. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Second panel: Oxygen concentration measured with a fast-responding micro-electrode and a stable optode. 
                The latter was used for calibration.
              </p>

              <p>
                hird panel: Cumulative oxygen fluxes with clear linear trends indicating a strong consistent flux signal 
                in the data. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Fourth panel: Oxygen fluxes, one for each 15 min data segment, and light (PAR) measured over the reef. 
                Positive fluxes represent a release.
              </p>

              <p>
                Note the large diurnal variation in concentration of ~100% (Second panel) and the tight correlation 
                between oxygen flux and light (Fourth panel), for example illustrated by the storm event that began at 
                hour 38 with large reduction in light and resulting decline in oxygen flux. For further details on the 
                data, see <a href="/berg/journals/Rheuban%20et%20al%202014%20MEPS.pdf">Rheuban 
                et al. (2014)</a>.
